Welcome. My name is Eduardo Bustamante.

I'm a [libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) enthusiast,
and do GNU/Linux server administration for a living.  I live in 
[British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia).

You can find me in Freenode as dualbus. I mainly lurk in `#bash` and `#gultij`.
If you want to send me private email, please use: dualbus -at- gmail _dot_ com.

I'm in these places on the Internet:
[github](https://github.com/dualbus),
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2654076), and
[twitter](https://twitter.com/dualbus).

You can find a nightly mirror of this website on
