Welcome. My name is Eduardo Bustamante.

I'm a [libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) enthusiast.
I do Linux server administration for a living.  I currently live in 
[Aguascalientes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguascalientes,_Aguascalientes).

You can find me on Freenode as dualbus/edualbus. I mainly lurk in `##bash-es`,
`##sed`, `#awk`, `#bash`, `#gultij` and `#python-es`.

If you want to send me private email, please use any of the following:
dualbus -at- gmail _dot_ com, dualbus -at- dualbus _dot_ me, or
dualbus -at- sdf _dot_ org.

For encrypted email, you can use [this key](/dualbus.asc).

Oh, I'm also on other places: [github](https://github.com/dualbus),
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2654076),
[twitter](https://twitter.com/dualbus), and
[google+](https://plus.google.com/+EduardoABustamanteLÃ³pez).
