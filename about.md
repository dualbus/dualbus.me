Welcome. My name is Eduardo Bustamante.

I'm a [libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) enthusiast,
and do GNU/Linux server administration for a living.  I live in 
[Aguascalientes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguascalientes,_Aguascalientes).

You can find me in Freenode as dualbus/edualbus. I mainly lurk in `##bash-es`,
`##sed`, `#awk`, `#bash`, `#gultij` and `#python-es`.  If you want to send me
private email, please use any of the following: dualbus -at- gmail _dot_ com,
dualbus -at- dualbus _dot_ me, or dualbus -at- sdf _dot_ org.  For encrypted
email, you can use [this key](/dualbus.asc).

Oh, I'm also on other places: [github](https://github.com/dualbus),
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2654076),
[twitter](https://twitter.com/dualbus), and
[google+](https://plus.google.com/+EduardoABustamanteLÃ³pez).

You can find a nightly mirror of this website on 
[sdf](http://dualbus.sdf.org/blog), and its source code in
[dualbus/dualbus.me](https://github.com/dualbus/dualbus.me).  This website is
supposed to render correctly in any standards compliant browser (*specially in
text-mode browsers like w3m*). If you find any error with the markup or
content, please let me know. Here's an RSS feed of the posts in the
[blog](/feed.xml), and a feed limited to posts related to
