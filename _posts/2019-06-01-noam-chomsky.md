[Noam Chomsky - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)

> Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher,
> cognitive scientist, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called
> "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic
> philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds
> a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts
> Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of
> Arizona, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics,
> war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with
> anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
>
> Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky
> developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New
> York City. At the age of 16 he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania,
> taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955
> he was appointed to Harvard University's Society of Fellows, where he developed
> the theory of transformational grammar for which he was awarded his doctorate
> in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, in 1957 emerging as a significant
> figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures,
> which remodeled the scientific study of language, while from 1958 to 1959 he
> was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.
> He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory,
> the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist
> program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism,
> being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.
>
> An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as
> an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public
> attention for his anti-war essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals".
> Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism
> and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work
> in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the
> Linguistics Wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later
> co-wrote Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, an
> analysis articulating the propaganda model of media criticism, and worked to
> expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Additionally, his defense of
> unconditional freedom of speech – including for Holocaust deniers – generated
> significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s. Following
> his retirement from active teaching, he has continued his vocal political
> activism, including opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy
> movement.
>
> One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array
> of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped
> spark a major revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development
> of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In
> addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading critic of
> U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the
> Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proved
> highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements,
> but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism
> or alleging that he is sympathetic to terrorism and genocide denial.

> Quite a number of interesting and important topics were raised by the students
> who invited me here, and I wish that there were time to talk about all of them.
> I hope you will feel free to bring them up in discussion, but I thought what I
> would try to do rather than trying to review those briefly is to focus on just
> one question, the most important question that’s ever been asked in human
> history, a question that should be uppermost in everyone’s mind. It’s been
> hanging over our heads like a “sword of Damocles” for many years, becoming more
> urgent every year, and it has now reached the point where the question will be
> answered in this generation.
>
> It’s your challenge to answer it, it can’t be delayed. The question is whether
> organized human life will indeed survive, and not in the distant future. The
> question was raised clearly to everyone with eyes open on August 6, 1945. I was
> then roughly your age. I happened to be at a summer camp, where I was a
> counselor. In the morning an announcement came over the loudspeaker saying that
> the United States had obliterated the city of Hiroshima with a single bomb, the
> atom bomb. People listened, a few expressions of relief, and then everyone went
> on to their next activity: a baseball game, swimming, whatever it might be.
>
> I was horrified, both by the news, and also by the casual reaction. I was so
> utterly horrified that I just took off and went off into the woods for a couple
> of hours to think about it. It was perfectly obvious if you thought about it
> for a second, not only about the horror of the event, but that humans in their
> glory had achieved the capacity to destroy everything. Not quite at that time,
> but it was clear that once the technology was established it would only develop
> further and escalate and reach the point of becoming what Dan Ellsberg in his
> recent book — central reading incidentally — calls “the doomsday machine,” an
> automatic system set up so that everything becomes annihilated, and as he
> points out, we have indeed constructed such a machine and we’re living with it.
>
> Coming forward until today, leading specialists in these topics echo much the
> same double concern, but now in more stark and urgent terms than 1945. One of
> the leading nuclear specialists, former defense secretary William Perry, has
> been touring the country recently, with the message that he is, as he puts it,
> doubly terrified, terrified by the severe and mounting threat of nuclear war,
> and even more so by the lack of concern about the possible termination of
> organized human life.
>
> And he’s not alone. Among others, General Lee Butler — formerly head of the US
> Strategic Command, which controls nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons policy —
> he recently reflected with deep remorse on his many years of service, in
> implementing plans for what is sometimes called “omnicide,” a crime far
> surpassing genocide, the crime of wiping out every living organism. He writes
> that “We have so far survived the nuclear age by some combination of skill,
> luck, and divine intervention, and I suspect the latter in greatest
> proportion.”
>
> And he adds a haunting question, “By what authority do succeeding generations
> of leaders in the nuclear weapons states usurp the power to dictate the odds of
> continued life on our planet? And most urgently, why does such breathtaking
> audacity persist at a moment when we should stand trembling in the face of our
> folly, and united in our commitment to abolish its most deadly manifestations?”
>
> And again, Ellsberg in his most recent book — and I urge that you read it, if
> you haven’t already — describes the record that he reviews, mostly from inside
> the government at the highest planning level for many years, he describes it as
> a chronicle of human madness, and that’s accurate enough. Repeatedly, we have
> come very close, ominously close, to terminal disaster. The record should
> really be studied carefully, it’s shocking. Sometimes it is due to the reckless
> acts of leaders, sometimes our leaders, very often through sheer accident. I’ll
> give you a couple of examples, there are actually hundreds, literally.
>
> Take one in 1960, when it was discovered that the Russians might soon have
> missiles, the first early warning system was set up to detect a missile attack.
> The first day it went into operation it provided to high leaders the
> information that the Russians had launched a missile attack, with 99.9 percent
> certainty. Fortunately, people did not react the way they were instructed to
> react, and it turned out that there had been some miscalculations, and the
> radar had hit the Moon and bounced back, when it wasn’t expected to bounce
> back. That’s one case.
>
> A couple of years later, in 1962, during what’s been called rightly the most
> dangerous moment in history — the Cuban Missile Crisis — the background is
> worth studying. I won’t have time to go into it, but it is reckless acts of
> leaders, including our own leaders. At the peak moment of threat of the Cuban
> Missile Crisis — which came extremely close to terminal disaster — at that
> moment there were Russian submarines outside the quarantine area that
> [President] Kennedy had established, and they were under attack by US
> destroyers that were dropping depth bombs on them. The conditions in the
> submarines were such that the crew could not really survive much longer,
> [because] they were not designed for service in the Caribbean , they were
> designed for the far north. The US did not know it at the time, but they had
> missiles with nuclear warheads, and the crew at some point decided, “Look,
> since they’re dropping bombs on us…” — they had no contact with anyone else,
> and thought there must be a nuclear war — “we might as well send off the
> ultimate weapon.” That would have been the end. There would have been a
> retaliation, and then we’re finished. To send off the missiles required the
> agreement of three submarine commanders. Two agreed, and one refused — Vasili
> Arkhipov — one of the reasons why we’re still here.
>
> Many other cases. In 1979, the national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski,
> was literally on the phone ready to call President Carter, saying that there
> was definite information of a massive Russian missile attack, when he got a
> call saying there was an error. So he didn’t call him.
>
> A year later, [President] Ronald Reagan came into office, and one of his first
> acts was to start a program to probe Russian defenses. The objective was to
> determine what kind of defenses the Russians had against our attack, if we had
> one. The official wording was “to practice command and staff procedures with
> particular emphasis on the transition from conventional to non-conventional
> operations, use of nuclear weapons.” The idea was to simulate air and naval
> attacks on Russia , with all of this made as public as possible to the
> Russians, because they wanted to see how they would react, including simulated
> nuclear attacks.
>
> At the time it was thought that the Russians would probably figure out that it
> was simulated and would not react. Now that the Russian archives came out, it
> turns out that they took it pretty seriously, just as we would certainly have
> done. In fact one of the leading US intelligence analyses that recently
> appeared concludes from the record — it’s title is “The War Scare Was For Real”
> — that they took it extremely seriously. Right in the midst of this — the
> Russian detection systems which were far more primitive than ours — they did
> detect an ongoing US missile attack. The protocol is for the human being who
> receives it — his name happened to be [Stanislav] Petrov — he’s supposed to
> take that information and send it up to the Russian high command, and then they
> decide whether to release a totally destructive missile attack on us. He just
> decided not to do it. He decided it was probably wasn’t serious — another
> reason why we’re alive. You can add him to the roll of honor.
>
> This goes on time after time. There have been literally hundreds of cases that
> came very close. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, as you probably know,
> established what they call “the doomsday clock” shortly after the atomic
> bombing. What they do is that every year a group of physicists, nuclear
> specialists, political and strategic analysts, get together and try to assess
> the state of the world and threats to the world, and set the minute hand of the
> doomsday clock a certain number of minutes before midnight. “Midnight” means
> say goodbye, we’re finished. The first setting, in 1947, was seven minutes to
> midnight. It reached the most frightening setting, just two minutes to
> midnight, in 1953, when what was easy to anticipate in 1945, had happened.
> First the United States, and then the Soviet Union, carried out tests of
> hydrogen bombs, vastly more destructive than atom bombs. In fact, an atom bomb
> is just used as a trigger to set it off, with huge destructive capacity.
>
> That meant that human intelligence had reached the point where we could easily
> destroy all life, no problem. And the minute hand reached two minutes then.
> Since then it has oscillated, but in recent years it’s been approaching
> midnight again. In January 2017, right after President Trump’s inauguration,
> the minute hand was advanced to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight. Last
> January [2018], after a year of Trump in office, it was advanced another half
> minute, to two minutes to midnight. That’s a sign that we have now matched the
> closest point to terminal disaster in the nuclear age, ominously close. That
> was January. A couple months later, President Trump’s nuclear posture review
> was released, and raises the dangers further. I presume that if the clock were
> set now, it might be moved another half minute to midnight.
>
> I will return to current crises, which are very real, how they are being
> handled, and what we might do about them, to avoid disaster. But first
> something else. Since 1945, we have been somehow surviving the nuclear age,
> actually miraculously, and we can’t count on miracles going on forever. What we
> didn’t know in 1945 was that humans were entering into another epoch, a new
> one, which is no less ominous. It’s what geologists call the Anthropocene, a
> new geological epoch in which human activity is destroying the environment.
>
> There have been debates among scientists about when to date the onset of the
> Anthropocene [epoch]. But last year the World Geological Society determined
> that a proper time to set it is right after World War II, the same time as the
> nuclear age. The reason is because of the sharp escalation at that point in
> human activities which were significantly damaging and will soon destroy the
> environment for organized life. We might add that the Anthropocene carries with
> it automatically a third major epoch which is called “the sixth extinction.” If
> you look through millions of year of history there have been periods in which
> some event caused a mass extinction of animal life. The last one was [65
> million] years ago, when an asteroid hit the Earth, and destroyed about 75
> percent of animal life, ending the age of the dinosaurs, and actually opened
> the way for small mammals to survive. They ultimately became us, and we are
> determined to become another asteroid, intent on destroying all or most animal
> life on Earth, and we’re well advanced in that process.
>
> So there are three major epochs that we’ve been living with: the nuclear age,
> the Anthropocene, and the sixth extinction, all accelerating. So let’s just ask
> how dangerous is the Anthropocene? I’ll give you a couple of illustrations from
> some of the leading scientific journals, and recent articles, starting with
> Nature, a British journal, the leading scientific article. The title of the
> article is “Global Warming’s Worst Case Projections Look Increasingly Likely.”
>
> [Reading from the article]: “A new study based on satellite observations finds
> that temperatures could rise nearly five degrees centigrade by the end of this
> century. The odds that temperatures could increase more than four degrees by
> 2010, in the current scenario, increased from 62 percent to 93 percent.”
>
> In other words, pretty near certain. If you go back to the Paris negotiations
> of December 2015, the hope was in the international negotiations that the
> temperature rise could be kept to 1.5 degrees centigrade rise, and they
> considered that maybe 2 percent would be tolerable. Instead we’re heading to 4
> or 5 percent, with very high confidence.
>
> Here’s one from a recent World Meteorological Organization: “Concentrations of
> carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surged at a record-breaking speed in 2016” —
> the last figures they have — “to the highest level in 800,000 years. The abrupt
> changes in atmosphere witnessed in the past 70 years” — the Anthropocene — “are
> without precedent in the geological record. Globally averaged concentrations of
> CO[2] reached over [410?] parts per million, up from just 400 parts per million
> in 2015,” which has been considered the upper tolerable limit, so we’re now
> beyond it.
>
> “The concentrations of CO[2] are now 150 percent above the pre-industrial
> level. Rapidly increasing atmospheric levels of CO[2] and other greenhouse
> gases have the potential to initiate unprecedented changes in climate systems,
> leading to severe ecological and economic destruction.”
>
> The last time the Earth experience a comparable concentration of CO[2] was
> somewhere around 3 to 5 million years ago. At that point the temperature was 2
> to 3 degrees centigrade above now, and the sea level was 30 to 60 feet higher
> than it is now. That’s what we’re moving to in the near future. In fact we’re
> going beyond because the prediction is 4 to 5 degrees centigrade. Well, I’ll
> leave the effects to your imagination.
>
> Here’s a final example, from Science, one of the leading American science
> journals: “Even slightly warmer temperatures, less than anticipated, in coming
> years, can start melting permafrost, which in turn threatens to trigger the
> release of huge amounts of greenhouse gases trapped in ice. There’s twice as
> much carbon in permafrost as in the atmosphere. This will release huge amounts
> of methane which is actually far more lethal than CO[2], although of shorter
> persistence. And that accelerates other processes that are already underway,
> like the rapid melting of polar ice. Polar ice, as it melts, reduces the
> reflective surface for the Sun’s rays, and creates more absorbent surfaces than
> dark seas. So that accelerates warming, and could lead to a non-linear process
> in which everything blows up. It’s leading among other things to the breaking
> up and melting of huge Antarctic ice caps. One of them, West Antarctica ,
> contains enough ice to raise sea level more than 10 feet.
>
> Pretty easy to continue… In brief the prospects are extremely serious, in fact
> they’re really awesome, which raises an obvious question: what are we going
> about it, how are we reacting? Well, the world is actually taking some steps,
> inadequate, but at least something, there’s a commitment. And states and
> localities in the United States are also taking steps, which is quite
> important. But what is of prime importance, of course, is the federal
> government, the most powerful institution in human history.
>
> So what is it doing? It’s withdrawing from the international efforts, but
> beyond that, it’s committed to increasing the use of the most destructive
> fossil fuels. So our federal government, for which we are responsible, is
> dramatically leading our race to destruction, while we sit and watch. That’s
> pretty astounding. That ought to be the screaming headline in every day’s
> newspaper, ought to be the main topic you study in every class. There’s never
> been anything like it. And it is astounding, as is the lack of attention,
> another doubly terrifying phenomenon. We should be asking, among other things,
> what this tells us about our society, and about our culture, what we are
> immersed in. And remember, all of this is imminent, we’re approaching this
> rapidly, this century, your task is to do something about it, and we’re
> ignoring it. We’re racing towards it, and we’re ignoring it.
>
> Meanwhile our chief competitor in destroying the planet, the Saudi Arabian
> dictatorship, has just announced plans to spend 7 billion dollars this year,
> for 7 new solar plants, and a big wind farm. That’s part of an effort on its
> part to move from oil, which destroys everything, to solar, renewable energy.
> This is Saudi Arabia. And that highlights how lonely we are in our race to
> destruction. Even the extreme reactionary dictatorship of Saudi Arabia, which
> lives on oil, refuses to join us in our unique insanity, which is dedicated to
> destroying organized human life.
>
> And it’s not just the current administration. The entire Republican Party
> leadership agrees. If you go back to the 2016 primaries, every single candidate
> denied that what was happening is happening, with the exception of those who
> were called “sensible moderates.” Jeb Bush, who said it’s all kind of
> uncertain, but we don’t have to do anything about it, because we’re producing
> more natural gas, thanks to fracking, in other words making it worse. The other
> sensible moderate, an adult in the womb as he was called, was John Kasich, the
> Governor of Ohio, he’s the one person who agreed that anthropogenic global
> warming is taking place, but he added, “We’re going to burn coal in Ohio , and
> we’re not going to apologize for it.” On ethical grounds, that’s the worst of
> all, when you think about it.
>
> Well, what about the media? They totally ignored this spectacle. Every crazy
> thing you can imagine was discussed extensively in the massive coverage of the
> primaries, but not the fact that the entire leadership of the party was saying,
> “Let’s quickly destroy ourselves.” Nothing — go back and check. Almost no
> comment about it. The denialism of the leadership is having an effect on public
> opinion.
>
> So Republican voters have been climate change skeptics for a long time, way
> beyond anything in the world, but it’s gotten far more extreme since Trump took
> office. And the numbers are pretty shocking. So by now, half of Republican
> voters deny that global warming is taking place at all. And only 30 percent
> think humans may be contributing to global warming. I don’t think you can find
> anything like that among any significant part of the population, anywhere in
> the world. And it should tell us something. One thing it should tell us is that
> there’s a lot to do for those who hope that maybe organized human life will
> survive. We’re not talking about a remote future. Just think about the numbers
> I gave you before. We’re talking about something imminent.
>
> Well let’s put [climate crisis] aside for a moment and go back to the growing
> threat of nuclear war. Are these ominous developments inexorable? So should we
> just throw up our hands in despair, and say okay, we’re finished, have a nice
> time, good-bye? That’s not at all true. There are very plausible answers in
> every single case that exists: diplomatic options are always open, and there
> are straightforward general principles that can be quite effective.
>
> One principle is quite simple: obey the law. Not a particularly radical idea.
> Almost unheard of, but it could have some consequences. So what is the law?
> Well there is something called the US Constitution which people are supposed to
> honor and revere. The Constitution has parts, Article Six for example. Article
> Six of the Constitution says that valid treaties are the supreme law of the
> land, and every elected official is required to observe them.
>
> What’s the most important treaty of the modern period? Unquestionably it’s the
> United Nations Charter. Article One of the Charter requires us to keep to
> peaceful means to resolve international tensions and disputes, and to refrain
> from the threat or use of force in international affairs. And I stress “threat”
> because that is violated all the time by every president and every high
> political leader. Every time you hear the phrase “all options are open,” that’s
> violating the supreme law of the land, if anyone cares.
>
> Let’s take a couple of examples. Let’s take Iran, an important example. A good
> deal of the talk about the possibility that Iran may be violating the joint
> comprehensive agreement — the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action], the
> “Iran deal” — there’s absolutely no evidence for that. US intelligence says
> they’re observing it, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] that
> carries out repeated inspections says they’re observing it completely.
>
> There’s a lot of discussion about it, but there’s no talk about something else:
> is the US violating the agreement? Try to check to see if anybody’s talked
> about that. The answer to that is pretty simple: the US is radically violating
> the agreement and has been all along. The agreement states that all
> participants — meaning us — are not permitted to impede in any way Iran’s
> re-integration into the global economy, particularly the global financial
> system, which we pretty much control, since everything works through New York.
> We are not permitted to interfere in any way with the normalization — I’m
> quoting it — the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran. We’re
> doing that all the time, and in fact are proud of it. All violations of the
> agreement. But it’s ignored on a principle that’s kind of interesting, the
> prevailing tacit assumption that the United States just stands above the law,
> including its own laws. So we don’t have to observe our laws, or any other
> laws, because we’re just unique, we do what we like.
>
> See if you can find an exception to that in the discourse on this topic. Well,
> in a couple of days as you know President Trump will probably withdraw from the
> treaty, possibly. That’s a gift to the hard-liners in Iran , it tells them that
> maybe they should return to nuclear programs. That’s an opening for the new
> national security advisor John Bolton, or Binyamin Netanyahu, both of whom have
> called for bombing Iran right away, even while they fully respect the terms of
> the agreement that we’ve already violated quite publicly, there’s no secret
> about it. And the consequences could be horrendous. But there happens to be a
> way of blocking those consequences, namely, by the very simple device of
> respecting our own law, in fact the supreme law of the land. Again, see if you
> can find the suggestion to that effect.
>
> Are there peaceful options? Pretty obviously, in this case, we could join the
> rest of the world, and permit the agreement to continue to function. Or better,
> we might turn to improvement of the agreement. That’s one thing that Trump has
> vociferously demanded. And there’s good ways to do that. One obvious proposal
> for improving the agreement, which is ignored entirely, is to move towards
> establishing a nuclear weapons free zone in the region. There are such
> agreements in various parts of the world, in Latin America, for example, and
> it’s a step towards mitigating the threat of disaster.
>
> So what about a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East? If that were
> established, it would end any conceivable Iranian threat that you could
> imagine. So is there a problem of establishing it? Actually there is one
> problem, but it’s not the one that comes to mind. There’s certainly no problem
> convincing Iran because they have been calling for this for years,
> vociferously. Certainly not any problem with the Arab world, they’re the ones
> who initiated the proposal 25 years ago. And the rest of the world agrees as
> well. There’s one exception: the United States refuses to allow this, and it
> comes up every couple of years in the annual review meetings of the
> Non-Proliferation Treaty, countries in which it’s continually brought up, and
> continually vetoed by the United States , most recently by President Obama in
> 2015.
>
> And the reasons are perfectly clear to everyone. The US will not permit Israeli
> nuclear weapons even to be examined by the International Agency [IAEA], let
> alone be dismantled. So therefore we can’t proceed with this very simple way of
> eliminating any nuclear threat from Iran or anyone else in the region.
>
> And also not discussed is that the United States and Britain have a special
> obligation, a unique obligation to pursue a nuclear weapons free zone in the
> Middle East. The reason is United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 — you
> can look it up on the internet — which was initiated by the US. This was the
> resolution that was initiated when the US and Britain, back in 1991, a
> resolution which called on Iraq to terminate any nuclear weapons programs. The
> US and Britain relied on this resolution in 2003 when they were trying to
> concoct some pretext for their planned invasion of Iraq. So they appealed to
> this resolution and said, we think Iraq is violating it, which in fact they
> weren’t, and they knew they weren’t.
>
> But if you read that resolution and go to Article Fourteen, it commits the
> signers to work for a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. So the US
> and Britain are uniquely committed to working for this by the Security Council
> resolution that they initiated. Again, check to see if it ever discussed.
>
> So in short, US willingness to observe US law could bring this crisis to a very
> quick end, and could even move on to a better solution. For example, if we were
> willing to observe Security Council resolutions that we ourselves have
> instituted to end the illegal threats of force by every recent president and
> other high officials, and to end our constant violations of the Iran nuclear
> agreement.
>
> So there’s an easy answer to this crisis, really simple: obey the law. Okay?
> That would end the crisis. Again, I would advise you to search to see how often
> this is discussed, and what that implies about our educational system, our
> culture, our media, our universities, and so on.
>
> Well, let’s turn to the other major threat, North Korea. There has been a
> proposal on the table for some years about how to reduce the threat in
> northeast Asia. It’s called a double-freeze. It was initiated by China,
> supported by North Korea, supported by Russia, general support throughout the
> world. The idea is that North Korea should freeze its weapons and nuclear
> programs, and in return the United States should call off the threatening
> military maneuvers that the US constantly carries out on North Korea’s border,
> including flights on the border by our most advanced nuclear-capable bombers,
> warning of the threat of total obliteration of North Korea, constantly
> happening.
>
> It’s no joke for the North Koreans — they have a little memory that we may want
> to forget, but at the end of the Korean War when it was more or less settled,
> US bombing was so intensive that there was nothing left to bomb, literally. So
> the Air Force General MacArthur started destroying dams, major dams, and if you
> read the Air Force history they exult about this. It happens to be a crime for
> which people were hanged at Nuremberg, but again, we’re above the law. But the
> North Koreans can remember, and when these advanced nuclear-capable bombers are
> flying they evoke some memory.
>
> So double-freeze is one possibility. Double-freeze could easily open the way to
> further negotiations, and at this point, the record becomes important, and you
> can find it, in the scholarly record, not in the press, but in the scholarly
> record. There have been successes in negotiations. The major one was in 2005.
> The Bush administration was pressured by international pressure to return to
> negotiations, and the negotiations were extremely successful. North Korea
> agreed — I’m quoting the final document — agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons
> and existing weapons programs, and to allow international inspections. In
> return for that the US agreed to establish a consortium that would provide

> others’ sovereignty, exist peacefully together, and take steps to normalize
> relations.
>
> Instantly, the Bush administration renewed the threat of force, froze North
> Korean funds that were in foreign banks, and disbanded the consortium that was
> to provide North Korea with a light-water reactor. The leading US Korea
> scholar, Bruce Cummings, writes that the sanctions were specifically designed
> to destroy the September pledges, and to head off an accommodation between
> Washington and Pyongyang. That was 2005, and I’ve been searching the press for
> some time to see if these facts could even be reported, breaking the constant
> refrain that North Korea has broken all agreements and so can’t be trusted. We
> can’t review it now, but I urge you to try, you’ll learn a lot.
>
> That path could be pursued again, but as we know, there are even better
> options, and it’s worth taking a close look at them. On April 27 [2018], North
> and South Korea signed a remarkable historic document — the Panmunjeom
> Declaration for Peace, Prosperity, Unification of the Korean Peninsula — and
> it’s worth reading carefully. I urge you to do that. Not the commentary, the
> actual words. In this declaration, the two Koreas “affirm the principle of
> determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord.” On their own
> accord. Continuing, “to completely cease all hostile acts against each other in
> every domain, to actively cooperate to establish a permanent and solid peace
> regime on the Korean Peninsula, to carry out disarmament on a phased level
> manner, to achieve the common goal of realizing through complete
> denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, to strengthen the positive
> momentum towards continuous advancement of inter-Korean relations, as well as
> peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean Peninsula.” And they further
> agreed “to actively seek the support and cooperation of the international
> community,” which means the United States, “for the denuclearization of the
> Korean Peninsula.”
>
> It’s important to read those words, their import is very clear. What they’re
> saying is, the US should back off and allow the two Koreas to achieve peace,
> disarmament, unification and complete denuclearization on their own, “on their
> own accord,” in the words of the declaration. So we, the United States, should
> accept the call for support and cooperation in this endeavor by the two parts
> of the Korean nation to determine their destiny “on their own accord.” To put
> it more simply, the declaration is a polite letter saying, “Dear Mr. Trump,
> declare victory if you want to prance around in public, but please go away and
> let us move towards peace, disarmament, and unification without disrupting the
> process.”
>
> That plea could hardly be more clear, and the general interpretation here is
> quite revealing. The general interpretation is that this complicates Washington
> ‘s strategy. As the New York Times explains, “Mr. Trump will find it hard to
> threaten military action against a country that is extending an olive branch.”
> Okay? That’s the liberal side. It’s entirely true that threatening military
> action, which happens to be a criminal act, us hard when the target is
> extending an olive branch, so we have some problems.
>
> Well, case after case — and I won’t go through other cases — we find that there
> are peaceful diplomatic options. We can’t ever be certain that they will work,
> but they should always be prioritized, in accordance with our international
> obligations, in fact, in accord with the supreme law of the land. Is this
> hopeless? No, far from it, we have plenty of evidence for that.
>
> So let’s go back to that very important date in modern history, November 8,
> [2016]. Huge coverage of that date, and several events happened that are
> significant. The least significant of those was the one that gets most of the
> coverage, the election of Donald Trump. It’s a little bit unusual, but not that
> far out of the norm, that a billionaire with a huge amount of campaign spending
> and huge media support wins the presidency. That’s kind of within the norm. But
> something really surprising did happen, the Sanders campaign broke with nearly
> all of American political history. For well over a century, American elections
> have been mainly bought, literally. You can predict the outcome of an election
> with almost complete certainty by just looking at campaign funding — there’s
> extensive, detailed, academic study of this, both for president and congress.
> What happened in November 2016 was different. For the first time, a candidate
> came very close to winning the nomination, and would have won the nomination,
> probably, if the Democratic Party managers hadn’t manipulated affairs to keep
> him out and he did it without any campaign funding from any of the major
> sources. No corporate funding, no wealth, no media support — he was either
> ignored, or denigrated in the media. That’s a real breakthrough. What’s more he
> ended up by becoming by far the most popular political candidate in the
> country. Take a look at the polls. You can see it on Fox News in fact, well
> above any other figure in popularity.
>
> In a democratic society the most popular political figure in the country just
> carried off a remarkable break in well over a century of political history,
> you’d hear him once in a while. Okay, I urge to you to take a look and make
> your own decisions. That’s a more important event that took place on November
> 8, 2016 .
>
> There’s another one that doesn’t get covered, but should. At that time the
> world was carrying out the successor negotiations to the Paris negotiations on
> climate change of December 2015, aimed at a verifiable treaty to do something
> about this ominous threat. They couldn’t reach a treaty, for one reason, the
> Republican Party would not permit it. So they couldn’t have a treaty, it was a
> voluntary agreement. The following year, 2016, they were meeting again to try
> to put some teeth into the treaty. On November 8th, the day of the American
> elections, the World Meteorological Organization — this was taking place in
> Marrakesh, Morocco — where the World Meteorological Organization released a
> study on the very dire state of the climate, the kind of thing that I gave a
> couple of samples of before. Then the election results came in, and the meeting
> basically stopped. The question before the international world is: can the
> world survive when the most powerful county in history is taken over by a
> political party that not only denies that what is happening is happening, but
> is committed to accelerate the race to destruction?
>
> And they kind of hoped that maybe China would save the world from disaster.
> Just think about that for a moment: maybe China will save the world from the
> disaster that the Republican Party is bringing to the world. I’ll let you think
> about that. But the fact is that there are plenty of things that can be done,
> and the success of the Sanders campaign and particularly in the aftermath, lots
> of things are going on that fed from it that could make a difference. But it
> doesn’t happen on its own — it takes serious engagement.
>
> Well, to go back to the beginning, your generation — that’s you — is facing the
> most awesome question that has ever arisen in human history. The question is:
> will organized human life survive? And we’re talking about the near future,
> can’t escape it. There are plenty of opportunities, but like it or not, it’s up
> to you to determine the fate of the human species. It’s an awesome
> responsibility, one that cannot be evaded. Thanks.

>
> 1.       Newman:  Mr. Chomsky, that impotence of voters, that angry impotence
> as you talk about, presumably you’d say that is what is responsible for the
> rise of Donald Trump.
> 2.       Chomsky:  It’s pretty clear what is responsible for the rise of the
> support for Trump and there’s general Agreement about it. If you take a simple
> look at economic statistics, the primary support for Trump is coming from
> mostly white, Working Class, poor People who’ve been cast by the wayside during
> the liberal period. They’ve lived through a generation of Stagnation or
> Decline. Real Wages are about what they were in the 1960s, but it’s also been a
> Decline in functioning Democracy. Overwhelming evidence reveals that even their
> own elected representatives barely reflect their interest and concerns.
> Contempt for Institutions, especially Congress, has just increased,
> skyrocketed. It’s down in single digits often. These are People who. Meanwhile
> there has, of course, been Wealth, Wealth created. It’s gone into very few
> hands, mostly into a fraction of the top 1%, so there’s enormous opulence.
> 3.       Newman:  Yes, indeed. How dangerous do you think this all is in terms
> of Donald Trump, for example? I mean, he has been toning down some of his most
> extreme pronouncements recently. He may, if he ever got anywhere near Power, he
> could be held in check by congressmen. How dangerous do you think he is to
> America?
> 4.       Chomsky:  Well, the greatest danger that he, and indeed every
> Republican candidate poses is barely mentioned. It’s kind of reminiscent of
> Sherlock Holmes’ dog that did not bark. The greatest danger is that there are
> two huge dangers that the human Species faces that we’re now in a situation
> where we have to decide whether the Species survives in a decent form. One is
> the rising danger of nuclear War, which is quite serious, and the other is
> environmental catastrophe. On these issues, Donald Trump and the other
> Republican candidates are basically uniform.
> 5.       Newman:  Do you believe that Hilary Clinton, the Democratic front
> runner, would champion those issues in a way that would satisfy you?
> 6.       Chomsky:  Not in any way that would satisfy me, but at least she
> recognizes that climate change is going on and that we have to do something
> about it. Every single Republican candidate denies that it’s happening with the
> sole exception of Casey, who says, "Sure, it’s happening, but we shouldn’t do
> anything about it." That’s having an impact.
> 7.       The Paris negotiations last December were aiming at a treaty. They
> couldn’t reach it for a simple reason, the Republican Congress would not accept
> it. It’s a voluntary Agreement which means even the weak standards that were
> proposed will be ... It undermines the likelihood that even they will be met.
> Every Republican candidate, including Trump, wants to eliminate the
> Environmental Protection Agency and Richard Nixon’s legacy to cut back
> Regulation, to restore the precipices as quickly as possible.
> 8.       On militarism, every one of them wants to raise the huge military
> budget. It’s already over half of discretionary spending leading right now is
> one factor leading to Confrontations, which could be extremely hazardous. This,
> again, is not being discussed.
> 9.       Newman:  Indeed, well I suggest one thing perhaps that you might agree
> with Donald Trump on would be about the EU. He talks about the fact that the UK
> may leave the EU. You’ve railed against European Union Bureaucracy. Could you
> agree with him on that?
> 10.   Chomsky: No, I don’t. In fact, I actually have no real strong opinion on
> Brexit, but my concern about it would be that it would weaken the European
> Union, but it would also probably leave Britain even more, don’t want to use
> too strong a word, subordinate to US Power than it is today, which I don’t
> think would be a good thing for the World or Britain.
> 11.   Newman: What, in a nutshell, is the answer to who rules the World now?
> 12.   Chomsky: As I try to discuss in the book, there is no simply answer. We
> usually think of States when that question is raised and with regard to States,
> there’s no doubt that the United States, despite its decline for many, many
> years, is still overwhelmingly more powerful than any State or Group of States.
> That’s only one factor. States have internal structures and internal
> distribution of Power. In the United States, Power is overwhelmingly, and
> increasingly in recent years, in the hands of a very narrow sector of corporate
> Wealth, private Wealth and Power. They have counterparts elsewhere who agree
> with them, who interact with them largely, and that’s another dimension that
> rules the World.
>   There’s also the Public. The Public can have, sometimes does have, enormous
> Power. We can go back to David Hume, first major modern Work on Political
> Philosophy, Foundations of the Theory of Government, pointed out that Force is
> on the side of the governed. Those who are governed have the Force if they are
> willing to and eager to and recognize the possibility to exercise it. Sometimes
> they do. That’s a major Force in who rules the World.
> 13.   Newman: When it comes to State Power, you don’t buy the idea of China is
> the next Superpower, the imminent Superpower?
> 14.   Chomsky: China? China plays a very important role in the World,
> undoubtedly. If you take a look at, say, per capita Income, it’s far behind the
> United States and other developed States. It has enormous internal problems
> like demographic, ecological, resources, and so on. It’s undoubtedly going to
> play an important. In military terms, it’s not even a fraction of the United
> States and Western Power. Yes, economically it’s significant, but bear in mind
> that a good deal of Chinese Production is actually foreign-owned. Apple,
> World’s major Corporation, happens to produce in China largely, but that’s US
> Production, which happens to use Chinese facilities, Labour and other
> facilities.
>   China is a growing, developing Power in some domains. In fact, it’s gone
> quite far even in high technology industries. For example, in Production of
> solar panels, China’s in the lead, not just in mass Production but also in
> innovation and high tech Development. All of this is significant, but is by no
> means a Power on the scale of the United States.
>   In fact, take a look at the Confrontations between China and the United
> States now. There are serious Confrontations. Are they in the Caribbean? Are
> they off the coast of California? No, they’re in Waters around China where
> China and others have territorial claims. That’s a symbolic reflection of the
> nature of State Power.
> 15.   Newman: Well, you described your scathing about the United States. No one
> would be surprised to hear that. You describe it as a leading terrorist State.
> I’m just interested how you describe Russia.
> 16.   Chomsky: How do I describe Russia? Authoritarian, brutal, and harsh.
> Carrying out ugly actions in its own region. The United States, on the other
> hand, Carries out such actions all over the World. In fact, again, look at.
> There are serious Confrontations between Russia and the United States. Once
> again, are they on the Mexican Border, the Canadian Border? No, they’re on the
> Russian Border. In fact, right at the point of the traditional invasion route
> through which Russia has been virtually destroyed several times in the past
> century, also earlier History, again it’s no apologetics for what Putin may be
> doing, but it should lead us to have a rational perspective on the Relationship
> between these Forces in the World.
>   As for the US being the leading terrorist State, I should say that’s hardly
> just my opinion. For example, when I was introduced, the person who introduced
> me said that how I regard the United States is the gravest Threat to World
> Peace. That’s not exactly, that misrepresents the situation. There are
> international polls run by the leading US polling agency, Gallop. It’s
> international affiliated. One of the questions they ask is: Which [Nation] is
> the gravest Threat to World Peace? The United States was first by a huge
> margin. Far behind, in second place, is Pakistan. That’s undoubtedly inflated
> by the Indian vote, and others have slight mention. That’s global opinion. I
> should mention that this was not even reported in the United States. It
> happened to be reported by BBC. It wasn’t reported in the United States.
>   As for being a terrorist State, President Obama’s global Assassination
> Campaign is an extreme terrorist War. I mean, if Iran, let’s say, was Carrying
> out a Campaign to assassinate People around the World who it thought might be
> planning to harm Iran, we would regard it as Terrorism. For example, if they
> were bombing the editorial offices of The New York Times and The Washington
> Post, which publish op-eds by prominent figures saying we should bomb Iran
> [fucking] right now, not wait, so obviously they want to harm Iran. Suppose
> Iran was assassinating them and anybody who happened to be standing around all
> over. Would we regard that as Terrorism? I think we would.
> 17.   Newman: Well, let me put a few questions to you from People online who
> are sending in questions via Facebook. First, Gary says, what are the dangers
> of TTIP?
> 18.   Chomsky: Of Putin?
> 19.   Newman: No, no, no, sorry. What are the dangers of tee-tee-eye-pee? The
> Transatlantic Trade Partnership? Tee-tee-eye-pee. Tee-tee-eye-pee.
> 20.   Chomsky: Tee-tee-eye-pee. Yeah, they’re pretty extreme, in fact. Chuckle
> of Newman. GreenPeace a couple of days ago released 280 pages of internal
> documents on this so called Trade Agreement, and they spell out details of what
> all of us should know. The so called Free Trade Agreements are not Free Trade
> Agreements. In fact, to a large extent they’re not even Trade Agreements. These
> are Investor rights Agreements. There’s a reason why they’re kept secret from
> the Public. As soon as you look at them, you see why. Notice I say secret from
> the Public, not secret. They’re not kept secret. They’re not secret to the
> corporate lawyers and lobbyists who are writing the detailed Regulations. Of
> course, in the interests of their constituents. It doesn’t happen to be the
> Public of the World or their own Countries. These are highly protectionist for
> the benefit of a private Power. So called intellectual property rights
> effectively raise Tariffs, they’re called Patents, which have an enormous
> impact on Economies. Wonderful for pharmaceutical and media conglomerates and
> others.
>   The Investors at Corporations are given the right to sue Government,
> something you and I can’t do but a Corporation can, to sue Government for
> harming their potentially future Profits. You can figure out what that means.
> Such cases are already in the courts. They’re not in the courts, they go to
> private adjudication Groups made up largely of corporate representatives.
> They’re already with NAFTA. We can expect more of them. There are provisions
> that undermine efforts at Regulation, including incidentally a Regulation of
> environmental dangers. Rather strikingly, the phrase climate change does not
> appear in these 280 pages, which are illustrative of the whole structure.
>   They have almost no. I should say these Agreements, so called Pacific and
> Atlantic, have virtually no effect on Tariffs. Tariffs are already quite low
> among the major trading partners. When you read the propaganda about it, it
> says, oh yeah, sure, Vietnam’s going to have to lower its Tariffs. Almost no
> effect on Trade. The major trading partners already have Agreements that have
> reduced the Tariffs very substantially with a few exceptions, not many. We
> should disabuse ourself of the illusion that these are Free Trade Agreements.
> Anything but. And to a large extent, not even Trade Agreements. We have the
> Experience of others like NAFTA, many years of Experience. Take, say, NAFTA, it
> has all of the aspects that I just described but even more, consider even what
> is called Trade Interactions across the US/Mexico Border. They’ve increased
> substantially since NAFTA. Economists will tell you Trade has greatly
> increased, but have a look at them. For example, suppose that General Motors
> that produces parts in Indiana sends them to Mexico for Assembly and sells the
> Car in Los Angeles. That’s called Trade in both directions, but it’s not. It’s
> Interactions internal to a command Economy. It’s as if during the days of the
> Soviet Union, parts were made say in Leningrad, sent to Warsaw for Assembly,
> then sold in Moscow. We wouldn’t call that Trade. That’s Interactions internal
> to a command Economy.
> 21.   Newman: Well, Noam Chomsky, thank you very much for being so generous
> with your time and for staying on to have that live online discussion. Thank
> you.

> - 00:00 why is there hatred against us there
> - 00:03 George Bush's famous question well
> - 00:05 everyone knows the answer to this a
> - 00:07 couple of days after the I mean they
> - 00:10 have to distinguish two things here
> - 00:11 there's a category of people called
> - 00:14 intellectuals their task is to make up
> - 00:17 fabrications that protect power and
> - 00:21 divert attention from what's obvious and
> - 00:24 indoctrinate people and so on they've
> - 00:27 concocted all sorts of complicated
> - 00:29 stories about globalization and you know
> - 00:31 failure din to the modern world and this
> - 00:34 that and the other thing okay we and
> - 00:36 they envy us because we're so wonderful
> - 00:38 etc etc are we put all that aside that
> - 00:40 standard propaganda let's talk about
> - 00:43 what is plainly the case and it is in
> - 00:47 fact discussed by serious people like
> - 00:49 say the Wall Street Journal so a few
> - 00:51 days after the September 11th the Wall
> - 00:54 Street Journal to it began running
> - 00:58 serious stories in which they
> - 01:01 investigated opinions of the people in
> - 01:04 the Islamic world who they're interested
> - 01:06 in what they called money Muslims the
> - 01:09 ones with the rich ones important ones
> - 01:11 so bankers international lawyers
> - 01:15 directors of multinational corporations
> - 01:18 people who are right inside the US
> - 01:21 system who certainly have no opposition
> - 01:22 to what's called globalization in fact
> - 01:25 that part of it who certainly hate in
> - 01:27 Laden because he's trying to kill them
> - 01:29 you know but who nevertheless agree with
> - 01:32 much of what he says and what they say
> - 01:35 is their opinions are that the United
> - 01:38 States supports brutal and corrupt
> - 01:40 regimes which block democracy and
> - 01:43 modernization and development they
> - 01:47 oppose particular policies like the
> - 01:49 decisive us support for the 35-year up
> - 01:53 military occupation of Palestinian
> - 01:57 territory which has been harsh and
> - 01:59 brutal and realized crucially on us
> - 02:02 military and diplomatic support you read
> - 02:04 in those papers that Israeli helicopters
> - 02:07 and jets are attacking Palestinians
> - 02:10 that's total fabrication
> - 02:11 US jets and US helicopters which
> - 02:15 happened to be piloted by Israeli pilots
> - 02:17 are attacking those concentrations
> - 02:20 that's what oughta be said Israel
> - 02:21 doesn't manufacture helicopters and wear
> - 02:24 f-16 and they understand all that they
> - 02:29 know that the US has been blocking any
> - 02:30 diplomatic settlement for active for 30
> - 02:33 years since dot offered 1 1971 it's not
> - 02:37 reported here and in the West's not
> - 02:39 talked about much but they know it the
> - 02:42 and they know what's going on there they
> - 02:44 also know perfectly well that the US and
> - 02:47 Britain are carrying out operations
> - 02:50 against Iraq which are devastating the
> - 02:52 civilian society and strengthening said
> - 02:54 on the saying and they also remember as
> - 02:57 Westerners like to forget that the US
> - 03:00 has no and Britain and France and
> - 03:02 Holland and so on have no opposition
> - 03:04 objection to that the Saddam Hussein's
> - 03:06 crimes we know that for sure because
> - 03:09 they support supported Saddam Hussein
> - 03:11 right through the period of his worst
> - 03:12 crimes gassing the Kurds unfollow
> - 03:16 chemical weapons they continue to
> - 03:18 support him very happily remained a good
> - 03:20 favoured friend an ally of the West
> - 03:23 which helped provide him with the means
> - 03:25 for developing weapons of mass
> - 03:27 destruction when he was really dangerous
> - 03:28 so they listen when Tony Blair and
> - 03:31 Madeleine Albright condemn Saddam
> - 03:34 because you know the ultimate monster
> - 03:36 even gassed his own people they listen
> - 03:38 but they add the words that are excluded
> - 03:42 in the West they say yeah he committed
> - 03:44 those crimes with your support okay
> - 03:47 rather crucial omission which you never
> - 03:50 hear from Tony Blair and the rest but
> - 03:53 they are not that indoctrinated so they
> - 03:56 remember that
> - 03:57 those elementary truths and those are
> - 03:59 other reasons why if you want there's
> - 04:01 hatred against us furthermore there's
> - 04:03 absolutely nothing new about this
> - 04:05 anybody who wants to understand any of
> - 04:08 it that's exactly where to go you go to
> - 04:10 the Declassified US record us a very
> - 04:13 open society we have Declassified
> - 04:15 records of internal deliberations from
> - 04:19 the past all these questions came up
> - 04:21 decades ago so in 19th and had the same
> - 04:24 answers in 1952 58 personal year for
> - 04:29 many reasons look I'm not talking about
> - 04:32 internal record the u.s. so the
> - 04:35 Eisenhower administration discussed
> - 04:37 three major crises for the United States
> - 04:40 one was Indonesia one was North Africa
> - 04:44 third was the Middle East all Islamic
> - 04:47 countries all oil producers the question
> - 04:51 arose whether the Russians were involved
> - 04:53 that was dismissed as ludicrous no
> - 04:55 Russian involvement
> - 04:57 it's just independent nationalism in the
> - 05:00 three countries which was the main
> - 05:01 crisis then Eisenhower pointed out with
> - 05:04 regard to the Middle East
> - 05:06 his words approximately he said there is
> - 05:09 a campaign of hatred against us not by
> - 05:12 the governments but by the people and
> - 05:15 that was an issue that was discussed no
> - 05:18 globalization you know no they hate us
> - 05:20 because we have McDonald's and none of
> - 05:21 this stuff why is there a campaign of
> - 05:24 hatred against us well the National
> - 05:26 Security Council have discussed it
> - 05:27 that's the highest analysis and planning
> - 05:30 body and they said the problem is that
> - 05:33 there's a perception among the people of
> - 05:35 the region that the United States
> - 05:37 supports corrupt and harsh regimes which
> - 05:42 prevent democratization and development
> - 05:46 and does so because of its interest in
> - 05:49 controlling near-east oil and they said
> - 05:52 it's hard to counter this perception
> - 05:53 because it's true and furthermore it
> - 05:57 should be true because we should support
> - 06:00 those regimes in order to maintain our
> - 06:02 control over Near East oil so therefore
> - 06:05 it
> - 06:05 campaign of hatred against us by the
> - 06:07 people who see that we're robbing their
> - 06:09 resources and preventing democracy and
> - 06:12 development but you know we can't do
> - 06:13 much about it because that's what we
> - 06:15 ought to be doing well you know like I
> - 06:17 say no McDonald's no and being us our
> - 06:20 magnificence no globalization just
> - 06:23 perfectly obvious things same reason why
> - 06:27 there was a campaign of hatred against
> - 06:29 England from the people of India or
> - 06:32 against Holland from the people of the
> - 06:34 East Indies and so on and so forth now
> - 06:36 you crush people under your boot they
> - 06:38 don't like it so this campaign of hatred
> - 06:40 against it in fact what they what they

> - 06:46 the same as what the Wall Street Journal
> - 06:48 found and in nineteen in 2001 you know
> - 06:54 and for the same reasons because the
> - 06:56 policies haven't fundamentally changed
> - 06:58 so that's so we understand I mean the
> - 07:01 Wall Street Journal only was concerned
> - 07:03 with a lead opinion if they'd gone down
> - 07:05 to the slums of Cairo there was gotten
> - 07:08 stronger opinions but of the same kind
> - 07:10 and more different ones also because in
> - 07:14 the slums of Cairo they wouldn't like
> - 07:15 the fact that the wealth of the region
> - 07:17 is going to the west and not to the
> - 07:19 people of the region the ones who The
> - 07:22 Wall Street Journal was talking about
> - 07:23 are quite happy about that because they
> - 07:25 are part of the ruling elite and they
> - 07:28 enrich themselves while the resources go
> - 07:31 to the west so they're part of the
> - 07:32 Imperial system so you get different
> - 07:34 opinions if you bother to ask people in
> - 07:37 the so-called streets but fundamentally
> - 07:39 it's the same so there's a camp so there
> - 07:42 are so bin Laden's messages certainly
> - 07:44 resonate and people agree with a lot of
> - 07:46 the things he's saying about 80 percent
> - 07:50 of Egyptians for example I say that the
> - 07:53 most important issue to them is the
> - 07:55 crushing of the Palestinians so when
> - 07:58 they hear bin laden say it they agreed
> - 08:00 as night to it with a like him or hate
> - 08:03 him
> - 08:04 on the other hand there is a clique of
> - 08:07 Terror radical Islamists who were
> - 08:10 organized and trained and brought
> - 08:12 together by Western intelligence for
> - 08:14 their own purposes and I've continued to
> - 08:16 do for 20 years just what they've always
> - 08:18 said they were going to do so while some
> - 08:21 things are obscure I don't think the

> - 00:00 you mentioned just in passing teenage
> - 00:06 girls if they have a free Saturday
> - 00:09 afternoon they like to walk around in
> - 00:13 the shopping mall rather than going to
> - 00:16 the library so I found that very
> - 00:23 thought-provoking
> - 00:25 because I think that many people and I
> - 00:28 would have to include myself believe
> - 00:34 that deep deep down what we all really
> - 00:40 want is material comfort for ourselves
> - 00:45 that this is what we all want more than
> - 00:50 anything else we we we may make an
> - 00:54 effort and go to the library we may make
> - 00:58 an effort and vote we may make an effort
> - 01:03 and go to work or even visit a sick
> - 01:09 friend or say a friendly word to someone
> - 01:13 who is in trouble but what we really
> - 01:18 would like to do is sit on a big
> - 01:21 comfortable sofa and watch a
> - 01:26 entertaining program on a big beautiful
> - 01:30 television set and maybe have somebody
> - 01:34 bring us some hot fudge sundaes or
> - 01:39 bonbons while we're watching the program
> - 01:43 that this is what people what I really
> - 01:47 like what what everyone is really like
> - 01:53 selfish and and really seeking material
> - 01:59 comfort and that that is human nature
> - 02:03 that is bedrock human nature and I think
> - 02:07 a lot of our political attitudes come
> - 02:10 from the fact that we think we can never
> - 02:13 get away from that that's what we are
> - 02:15 now do you share that view not Melissa
> - 02:20 and I think the plenty of evidence
> - 02:23 against it there is has been a massive
> - 02:26 effort for over a hundred years to try
> - 02:30 to convince people that that's what we
> - 02:32 are
> - 02:33 it's called advertising there so it's a
> - 02:36 huge industry it's dedicated explicitly
> - 02:41 openly to trying to you read the
> - 02:43 business person hundred years ago and
> - 02:45 it's taking off to try to direct people
> - 02:50 to the superficial things of life like
> - 02:52 fashionable consumption get them out of
> - 02:56 our hair by getting them involved in
> - 02:58 consumption and huge efforts go into
> - 03:02 this
> - 03:03 for example about 20 or 30 years ago the
> - 03:06 advertising industry realized that
> - 03:08 there's a sector of the population that
> - 03:12 they're not reaching because they don't
> - 03:14 have money known as children so then
> - 03:17 some bright guys figured well we can get
> - 03:20 around this the children don't have
> - 03:22 money but their parents do so what we
> - 03:24 have to do is direct television programs
> - 03:28 for children and so on to try to induce
> - 03:32 what's called nagging try to get fit
> - 03:35 this is literally the case create
> - 03:38 nagging propaganda by now if you look at
> - 03:41 academic Applied Psychology departments
> - 03:45 there is actually program studying
> - 03:47 different kinds of nagging and how you
> - 03:48 can induce it and if you watch
> - 03:50 children's television I've seen this
> - 03:52 with my grandchildren it's two year old
> - 03:54 kids or looking at things and they're
> - 03:56 being induced to try to get your parents
> - 04:00 to get me this thing or also I'm going
> - 04:03 to die you know and so on and the
> - 04:05 parents get it and you throw it away in
> - 04:07 five minutes but every aspect of our
> - 04:09 life is to cook devoted to this okay my
> - 04:14 wife and I but we're taken by a friend a
> - 04:16 couple weeks ago to see a what do you
> - 04:19 call it the baseball in the preparations
> - 04:23 of pre-season baseball spring period
> - 04:27 right and you take a look at the stadium
> - 04:30 every inch is covered with an ad I mean
> - 04:33 I remember first baseball game I went it
> - 04:36 was in the 1930s there were no ads
> - 04:38 anywhere now every inch is an ad every
> - 04:42 taxicab you look at is not every minute
> - 04:44 of your life is inundated with efforts
> - 04:47 to turn you into the kind of person
> - 04:49 you're describing
> - 04:51 so is that human nature I don't think so
> - 04:54 so take a look at these Trump voters
> - 04:56 again so these working-class people and
> - 04:59 as a rural towns which manufacturing
> - 05:02 towns in Arkansas and take a listen to
> - 05:05 what they're saying these are people who
> - 05:07 men who want to work in coal mines which
> - 05:10 is not fun rather than to take a
> - 05:13 government handout they don't want to
> - 05:16 sit on the couch and being given a
> - 05:18 government handout that undermines their
> - 05:21 sense of dignity of self-worth of doing
> - 05:24 something significant and I think that's
> - 05:26 what people are you go back further
> - 05:30 plenty of evidence for it there's
> - 05:32 there's a wonderful study of huge study
> - 05:36 of the reading habits of the British
> - 05:39 working class in the late 19th century
> - 05:41 Jonathan rose very detailed said what
> - 05:44 were British workers reading turns out
> - 05:47 they were better educated than than the
> - 05:50 aristocrats American say eastern
> - 05:53 Massachusetts Boston where I live the
> - 05:55 the an Irish blacksmith if he could make
> - 06:00 enough money would hire a boy to read to
> - 06:03 him while he's working I'm not going to
> - 06:05 remember this from childhood in the
> - 06:07 1930s most of my family were
> - 06:10 for immigrants you know first first
> - 06:13 generation unemployed working-class
> - 06:15 quite educated many of them didn't go to
> - 06:18 school you know maybe fourth grade but
> - 06:20 they read they went to concerts they
> - 06:24 went to Shakespeare plays they talked
> - 06:26 about it they were interested in
> - 06:27 politics I mean I think it's taken huge
> - 06:31 efforts to try to drive all of this out
> - 06:33 of people's heads I think the natural
> - 06:36 thing for humans is to want to be
> - 06:38 independent creative whether created I
> - 06:43 mean maybe you work on a you know the
> - 06:46 fixing up old cars in your garage in the
> - 06:50 weekend instead of sitting in the
> - 06:51 watching television whatever it may be
> - 06:53 you want to do something that's
> - 06:55 significant that's worth it's worthwhile
> - 06:58 maybe even if it's a ugly horrible job
> - 07:01 like we're going to call nine instead of
> - 07:03 taking a government handout because
> - 07:06 people I think want a dignity and a
> - 07:08 sense of self-worth and a sense of
> - 07:09 creating and doing something important
> - 07:12 that's what we are and I think it's
> - 07:14 taken huge effort enormous efforts a
> - 07:18 huge part of the economy is devoted to
> - 07:20 trying to drive these things out of
> - 07:22 people's heads to make you think that
> - 07:25 all you want is more commodities so you
> - 07:28 should go shopping instead of reading
> - 07:29 Latin so that people most people by this
> - 07:38 account really have been unnaturally
> - 07:44 squashed into being something much much
> - 07:47 smaller than they could be or than he
> - 07:50 should be and want to be and want to be
> - 07:53 in fact it's pretty interesting to go
> - 07:55 back to there's good studies of the
> - 07:58 working-class press in the early
> - 08:02 industrial revolution in the United star
> - 08:06 inland it's earlier in the United States
> - 08:07 it would be mid nineteenth century late
> - 08:10 nineteenth century it was a very lively
> - 08:12 working-class press a lot of it written
> - 08:15 by young women
> - 08:16 young women from the farms called
> - 08:19 factory girls who run their own
> - 08:21 newspapers and the material is a lot of
> - 08:24 material on and it's pretty interesting
> - 08:26 that what they wanted was dignity they
> - 08:30 hated the industrial system because it
> - 08:33 was turning that it was destroying their
> - 08:35 rights as independent people they
> - 08:39 attacked what sometimes they called the
> - 08:42 idea the slogan they denounced the
> - 08:46 slogan gain wealth forgetting all but
> - 08:49 self in other words the kind of person
> - 08:52 that you think we all are that we're
> - 08:54 taught we all are that's what they were
> - 08:56 condemning we don't just gain wealth
> - 08:59 forgetting all but self we want
> - 09:01 dignified independent lives they
> - 09:04 regarded wage labor as not very
> - 09:07 different from slavery which was a
> - 09:10 popular idea there was a slogan of the
> - 09:12 Republican Party literally Abraham
> - 09:14 Lincoln's on because it takes what
> - 09:16 you're selling yourself if you're a wage
> - 09:19 laborer if you sell something you

> - 09:25 you're not selling yourself if you sell
> - 09:28 your labor you're selling yourself
> - 09:30 you're losing your dignity and

> - 10:51 part of the economy goes into this an

> TRANSCRIPT - VIDEO - Noam Chomsky: You Can't Have Capitalist Democracy
>
> You Can't Have Capitalist Democracy.
>
> I started by saying that one of the relations between capitalism and
> democracy is contradiction. You can't have capitalist democracy, and
> the people who really sort of believe in markets (or at least pretend
> to understand them) - so if you read Milton Friedman and other
> philosophers of so-called libertarianism - they don't call for
> democracy they call for what they call 'freedom.'
>
> There is a very constrictive concept of freedom. It's not the freedom
> of a working person to control their work, their lives, and so on; it's
> their freedom to submit themselves to control by a higher authority.
> That's called 'freedom', but not 'democracy'. They don't like democracy
> and they're right; capitalism and democracy really are inconsistent.
>
> Actually, what's called libertarianism in the United States, is about
> as an extreme example of anti-libertarianism that you can imagine.
> They're in favour of private tyranny – the worst kind of tyranny.
> Tyranny by private, unaccountable, concentrations of wealth. When they
> say, “Well, we don't want government interference in the market”, they
> mean that. They mean - maybe they don't understand it, but if you think
> it through, it's pretty obvious – the kind of interference in the
> market they want blocked is the kind that would permit unconstrained
> tyranny on the part of totally unaccountable private tyrannies, which
> is what corporations are.
>
> It's worth bearing in mind how radically opposed this is to classical
> liberalism. They like to invoke, say, Adam Smith. But if you read Adam
> Smith, he said the opposite. He's famous for not, you know, the claim
> is that he was opposed to regulation – government regulation –
> interference in markets. That's not true. He was in favour of
> regulation, as he put it, when it benefits the working man. He was
> against interference when it benefited the masters. That's traditional
> classical liberalism.
>
> This, what's called 'libertarian' in the United States, which likes to
> invoke the history that you’ve concocted, is radically opposed to basic
> classical libertarian principles and it's kind of astonishing to me
> that a lot of young people - say, college students - are attracted by
> this kind of thing. I mean, you can, after all, read the classical
> text.
>
> So take, say, Adam Smith. Adam Smith, at the time – he's the icon, you
> know. He was considered to be a dangerous radical at the time, because
> he was pretty anti-capitalist in this pre-capitalist era that he was
> opposed to, and he condemned what he called the 'vile maxim of the
> masters of mankind': all for ourselves and nothing for anyone else.
> That's an abomination. Take the phrase 'invisible hand' – everybody's
> learned that in high school or college – Adam Smith actually did use the
> term, rarely. But take a look how he used it. In Wealth of Nations, his
> major work, it's used once. And if you look at the context, it's an
> argument against what is now call neo-liberal globalization and what he
> argued is this (in terms of England, of course): he said, suppose in
> England that the merchants and manufacturers invested abroad & imported
> from abroad; he said, well that would be profitable for them, but it
> would be harmful to the people of England. However, they will have
> enough of a commitment to their own country, to England (it's called a
> 'home bias', in the literature); they'll have enough of a 'home bias'
> so that, as if by an invisible hand, they'll keep to the less
> profitable actions and England will be saved from the ravages of what
> we call neo-liberal globalization. That's the one use of the term in
> Wealth of Nations.
>
> In his other major work, Moral Sentiments, the term is also used once,
> and the context is this - remember, England is basically an
> agricultural country then - he says: suppose a landlord accumulates an
> enormous amount of land everyone else has to work for.  He says:  well,
> it won't turn out too badly, and the reason is that the landlord will
> be motivated by his natural sympathy for other people.  So he will make
> sure that the necessities of life and the goods available will be
> distributed equitably to the people on his land, and it will end up
> with a relatively equal and just distribution of wealth, “as if by an
> invisible hand”. That's his other use of the term.
>
> Just compare that with what you're taught in school, or what you read
> in the newspapers. And it goes across the board. Like, everybody
> probably has read the first paragraphs of Wealth of Nations, which
> talks about how wonderful it is that the butcher pursues his interests,
> and the baker pursues his interests, and we're all happy, so we should
> be in favour of a division of labour. Everybody's read that. How many
> people have read a couple of hundred pages into Wealth of Nations,
> where he has a bitter attack on division of labour for interesting
> reasons, and reasons that were standard in the Enlightenment in which
> he lived (very different from ours)? He says if you pursue division of
> labour, people will be directed to actions in which they'll complete
> the same mechanical actions over and over. They'll be de-skilled and
> that's the goal of management for over over 100 years: de-skill the
> workforce. He says that's what will happen if you pursue division of
> labour. He goes on to say, this will turn people into creatures as
> stupid and as ignorant as a human being can possibly be and, therefore,
> in any civilized society, the government will have to intervene to
> prevent any development like this. That's Adam Smith's view of division
> of labour.
>
> Next step – now, here's a research project.  Take the standard edition
> (scholarly edition) of Wealth of Nations produced by the University of
> Chicago Press – naturally, on the bicentennial – with a scholarly
> apparatus (you know, footnotes and everything else) – and take a look
> at the Index.  There's a scholarly index. Look up 'division of labour'.
> This part of the book is not referenced. You can't find it, unless you
> decided to read 700 pages; then you can find it.
>
> But that's his concept of the division of labour, and it continues like
> this – and I'm not extolling, you know, a lot of things that you can
> harshly criticize, like his advice to the colonies – but, nevertheless,
> it's a very different picture from what's called 'libertarianism' or
> 'capitalism' today.
>
> Capitalist democracy would self destruct - capitalism would self
> destruct – and that's why it hasn't been instituted. The masters
> understand that they cannot survive a capitalist economy – a laissez
> fair economy.
>
> Take a look at the history; it's pretty interesting.
>
> So the United States, when it was independent – so it could reject the
> rules of sound economics and develop. There were other countries that
> were poised for an industrial revolution and were given the same
> advice. Like Egypt and India. In fact, India already was the commercial
> and industrial center of the world, more so than England . Egypt was
> poised for an industrial revolution and it's not impossible that it
> might have developed as a rich, agrarian society. It had cotton –
> produced cotton. As I said, that's the main product (like oil today),
> and it didn't need slaves. It had peasants. It had a developmental
> government aimed that the industrial development. It could have taken
> off – just as India could have taken off. But they were not free to
> reject sound economics because they were ruled by British force. So
> they were forced to accept sound economics, and Egypt became Egypt, and
> the United States became the United States. India went through a
> century of de-development before it finally got independent.
>
> That's what happens when you apply laissez fair principles. In fact,
> that's essentially how the Third World and the First World divided.
> Take a look at the countries that developed. They are the countries who
> violated the principles. England, the United States, Germany, France,
> Netherlands. One country of the south. One country developed: Japan.
> The one country that wasn't colonized and was able to pursue the same
> course that the rich countries developed.
>
> I mentioned that in mid Nineteenth Century – 1846 - Britain was so far
> ahead of the rest of the world in industrial development that they did
> decide that laissez faire would be possible, so that moved to what's
> called a 'free trade era'.
>
> First of all, they imposed sharp constraints on it. They've cut off the
> Empire. India. India was not allowed. Others could not invest in India,
> their main possession; and India was not allowed to develop. And there
> were other restrictions.
>
> Pretty soon, British capitalists called the game off because they
> couldn't compete. By the 1920s, they couldn't compete with Japanese
> production so they literally closed off the Empire to Japanese exports.
> It's part of the background for the Pacific War of the 1940s.
>
> The United States did the same with a smaller empire in the
> Philippines. The Dutch did the same with Indonesia. All the imperial
> systems decided: no more free trade, we can't compete. So they closed
> off the empire and Japan had no markets, no resources, and they went to
> war. That's a large part of the background.
>
> The United States, in 1945, did move towards laissez fair. In fact it
> was an important conference (the united states was basically running
> the world at that point, for obvious reasons) – there was a hemispheric
> conference called by Washington in February 1945 in Mexico, where the
> western hemisphere was compelled to adopt an economic charter for the
> Americas, which banned any interference with market principles. The
> goal was, in the State Department reports, to oppose the new
> nationalism in Latin America, which is based on the idea that the
> people of a country should benefit from the country's resources. That's
> 'evil', we can't allow that; it's Western and US investors who have to
> benefit from the resources.
>
> So that was the economic charter of the Americas imposed on the
> countries of the southern hemisphere, with one exception – here. The
> United States did not follow those policies. Quite the contrary.
>

> Hi.
>
> Well, let me begin with two recent events, both of them widely publicized.
>
> The first has to do with the famous Salman Rushdie case. A couple of days ago,
> you may have noticed, the Prime Minister of Iran suggested a very simple way to
> resolve the crisis concerning Rushdie, he suggested that what should happen is
> that all the copies of his book, The Satanic Verses, should simply be burned.
> And I guess the implication is that if that happened then they could cancel the
> death sentence. That’s one case. Lots of coverage.
>
> Second case had to do with an interesting thing that happened here. There was
> a- what some people are calling, a mega-merger of two media giants — Time
> Incorporated and Warner Communications Incorporated — each of them huge
> conglomerates, and putting- coming together they form, apparently, the biggest-
> the world’s biggest media empire. Now, that also had a lot of publicity, even
> outside the business pages, and there was concern over the effects of the
> merger, by increasing media concentration so effectively, the effects on
> freedom of expression.
>
> Well these two events are- they seem rather remote from one another, and in a
> sense they are. But we can draw them together by recalling an event which was
> not considered important enough to be reported, but which I happen to know
> about because I was personally involved.
>
> The title for this talk is, you may have noticed, Manufacturing Consent: The
> Political Economy of the Mass Media. That’s actually the title of a recent book
> that I was co-author of with- my co-author is Edward Herman, and the two of us
> have been working together for many years. We- the first- our first book was
> published in 1974, a book on American foreign policy and the media, in fact,
> and it was published by a publisher, a textbook publisher, flourishing textbook
> publisher, which happened to be a subsidiary of Warner Communications
> Incorporated.
>
> Well, unless you’re a very rare person you never saw that book. And the reason
> was that when the advertising for the book appeared, after 20,000 copies were
> published, one of the executives of Warner Communications saw the advertising,
> and didn’t like the feel of it, and asked to see the book, and liked it even
> less, in fact, was appalled. And then followed a- an interaction which I won’t
> bother describing, but the end result of it was that the parent company, Warner
> Communications, simply decided to put the publisher out of business, and to end
> the whole story that way.
>
> Now, they didn’t burn the books, they pulped them, which is more civilized.
> Also, books don’t burn very well actually, I’m told, they’re kind of like
> bricks, but pulping works. And it wasn’t just our book that was eliminated, it
> was all the books published by that publisher.
>
> Well, there are a couple of differences between this and the case of the Prime
> Minister of Iran. One difference is that this was actually done, not just
> suggested. The second difference is it wasn’t just one book, it was all books,
> which happened to be tainted by being published by the publisher who had done
> this bad thing. A third difference is the reaction. The reaction in the case of
> Warner Communications putting the publisher out of business to prevent them
> from publishing our book, the reaction to that was zero. Not because it wasn’t
> known, it just was not considered of any significance. Whereas the Rushdie
> affair, of course, has had a huge furor, as it should, and the Prime Minister’s
> proposal was greeted with ridicule and contempt as a demonstration of what you
> can expect from these barbarous people. So there are some differences.
>
> Well, let’s go back to the question about the mega-merger. Would the- will this
> new media empire restrict freedom of expression by excessive media
> concentration? Possibly, but the marginal difference is slight given what
> already exists, as is, perhaps, illustrated by this case. This is,
> incidentally, not the only case, far from the only case, which illustrates how
> hypocritical and cynical the reaction to the Rushdie affair is. The reaction is
> legitimate, but we can ask the question whether it’s principled or not. And if
> we look, I think we find that it’s not.
>
> Well actually, this whole story that I’ve just told is kind of misleading. It’s
> accurate in identifying the locus of decision-making power — not only in
> publishing and in the media, but in political life and in social life generally
> — in that respect it’s accurate, but it’s very misleading with regard to how
> that power is typically exercised. This is a very unusual case. I wouldn’t want
> to suggest that this is what happens typically. It’s usually much more subtle
> than this, but no less effective. Now, I’m going to come back to some of the
> more subtle ways, and the reasons for them, and in fact if there’s time, or
> maybe back in discussion, I’ll talk about the aftermath of this particular
> incident, which is also kind of illuminating in this respect, though more
> complex.
>
> Well, with that much as background let me turn to the main topic, manufacturing
> consent, a- a topic- and, thought control and indoctrination and so on. Now,
> there’s a- and, I’m going to discuss how this relates to the media.
>
> Now, there is a standard view about the media and the way they function. The
> standard view is expressed, for example, by Supreme Court Justice Powell, when
> he describes what he calls the crucial role of the media in effecting the
> societal purpose of the first amendment, that is, enabling the public to assert
> meaningful control over the political process. So the idea is, this is a kind
> of an instrumental defense of the first amendment. The value to be achieved is
> the democratic process, and for the democratic process to function, it’s
> necessary for the public to have free access, open access to relevant
> information and opinion- a wide range of opinion, and it’s the job of the media
> to ensure that, and the first amendment has the instrumental function of
> guaranteeing that this is served, and the media then do it. That’s the standard
> view. And notice that it has a kind of a descriptive component and also a
> normative component. It says, this is what the media ought to be like, and this
> is what they are like.
>
> Now, that they ought to be this way seems sort of obvious, in fact, kind of
> almost tautological, if democracy means- has something to do with the public
> having a capacity to shape their own affairs, it obviously presupposes
> information, and that means the information system in a free society would have
> to serve this function.
>
> Since it seems so obvious, it’s worth bearing in mind that there is a contrary
> view. And in fact, the contrary view is very widely held. In fact, I wouldn’t
> be surprised if the contrary view is the dominant view among people over the
> last couple of centuries who have thought about liberal democracy and freedom,
> and how it ought to function. In any event, it’s certainly a major position.
>
> This contrary view can be traced back to the origins of modern democracy in the
> 17th century English revolution, when, for the first time, the- there was a
> challenge to the right of authority — whether it was the gentry, or the king,
> or whatever — and there was actually the beginnings of a real, radical,
> democratic movement, with a commitment on the part of the people involved, who
> were very widespread in England, to public involvement and control over
> affairs. They didn’t want to be ruled by the king, and they didn’t want to be
> ruled by parliament, they wanted to run their own affairs. And they were
> defeated, the radical democrats were defeated, but not before doing some
> important things which had a lasting effect.
>
> Well, what I’m interested in now is the reaction to this. The reaction to the
> first efforts at popular democracy — radical democracy, you might call it —
> were a good deal of fear and concern. One historian of the time, Clement
> Walker, warned that these guys who were running- putting out pamphlets on their
> little printing presses, and distributing them, and agitating in the army, and,
> you know, telling people how the system really worked, were having an extremely
> dangerous effect. They were revealing the mysteries of government. And he said
> that’s dangerous, because it will, I’m quoting him, it will make people so
> curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to
> a civil rule. And that’s a problem.
>
> John Locke, a couple of years later, explained what the problem was. He said,
> day-laborers and tradesmen, the spinsters and the dairy-maids, must be told
> what to believe; the greater part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.
> And of course, someone must tell them what to believe. Now, there’s a modern
> version of that — and of course he didn’t just mean those categories, he meant
> the general public — there’s a modern version of that. This goes all the way up
> to the modern times, it’s discussed in the American revolution, and all the way
> through to the modern period. But let’s just come up to the contemporary
> period.
>
> Now in the last- in the modern period you get a much more sophisticated
> development of these ideas. So, for example, Reinhold Niebuhr, who is a
> much-respected moralist and commentator on world affairs, he wrote that
> rationality belongs to the cool observers, but because of the stupidity of the
> average man, he follows not reason but faith. And this naive faith requires
> that necessary illusions be developed. Emotionally potent oversimplifications
> have to be provided by the myth-makers to keep the ordinary person on course,
> because of the stupidity of the average man. That’s the same view, basically.
>
> Walter Lippman, who was the dean of American journalists, is the man who
> invented the phrase manufacture of consent. He described the manufacture of
> consent as a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government.
> This, he said, is quite important, this is a revolution in the practice of
> democracy, and he thought it was a worthwhile revolution. The reason is, again,
> the stupidity of the average man. The common interests, he said, very largely
> elude public opinion entirely, and they can be managed only by a specialized
> class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality. That’s Niebuhr’s cool
> observers. You can guess who’s part of them. The person who pronounces these
> views is always part of that group. It’s the others who aren’t. This is in
> Walter Lippman’s book Public Opinion, which appeared shortly after World War I.
> And the timing is important.
>
> World War I was a period in which the liberal intellectuals, John Dewey’s
> circle primarily, were quite impressed with themselves for their success, as
> they described in their own words, for their success in having imposed their
> will upon a reluctant or indifferent majority.
>
> Now, there was a problem in World War I. The problem was that the population
> was, as usual, pacifistic, and didn’t see any particular reason in going out
> and killing Germans and getting killed; if the Europeans want to do that,
> that’s their business. And in fact, Woodrow Wilson won the 1916 election on a
> mandate, which was, peace without victory. That’s how he got elected. And, not
> surprisingly, he interpreted that as meaning victory without peace. And the
> problem was to get this reluctant and indifferent majority, and get them to be-
> to create emotionally potent oversimplifications and necessary illusions, so
> that they would then be properly jingoistic, and support this great cause.
>
> And the liberal intellectuals were convinced that they were the ones who had
> primarily succeeded in doing this, and they thought it was a very good task,
> for obvious reasons. And, in fact, they probably had some role. Whether they
> had as much role as they think you could question, but some role. They used all
> sorts of necessary illusions, for example, fabrications about Hun atrocities,
> Belgian babies with their arms torn off, and all sorts of things that were
> concocted by the British foreign service and fed to the educated classes in the
> United States, who picked them up and were quite enthusiastic about them, and
> distributed them. They used such devices as, what they called, historical
> engineering. That was a phrase proposed by Frederick Paxon, an American
> historian who was the founder of a group called the National Board for
> Historical Service. That was a group of historians who got together to serve
> the State by explaining the issues of the war that we might better win it.
> That’s historical engineering.
>
> The Wilson administration established the country’s, I think, first official
> propaganda agency — it’s called the Creel Commission — which was dedicated to
> convincing this reluctant or indifferent majority that they’d better be
> properly enthusiastic about the war that they were opposed to.
>
> That had some institutional consequences. In fact, there were a number of
> institutional consequences to this whole period. One was the institution of the
> national political police, the FBI, which has been dedicated to thought control
> and repression of freedom ever since; that’s it’s primary activity. And another
> development- institutional development was the enormous growth of the public
> relations industry.
>
> A lot of people learned lessons from the capacity to control the public mind,
> as they put it — slogan of the public relations industry. One of the people who
> came out of the Creel Commission was a man named Edward Bernays, who became the
> patron saint of the public relations industry. That’s a big, substantial
> industry which is actually an American creation, though it’s since spread
> throughout other parts of the world. It’s dedicated to controlling the public
> mind, again quoting it’s publications, to educate the American people about the
> economic facts of life to ensure a favorable climate for business, and, of
> course, a proper understanding of the common interests.
>
> Bernays developed the concept of engineering of consent, which, he said, is the
> essence of democracy. That’s- and of course he didn’t bother saying that there
> are only some groups who are in a position to carry out the engineering of
> consent — those who have the power and the resources.
>
> He himself showed how this was done. Often. By, for example, demonizing the
> government of Guatemala, the capitalist democratic government that we were
> planning to overthrow with a successful CIA coup. He was then working for the
> United Fruit Company, which was opposed to the government because it was
> planning to take over unused lands of the United Fruit Company, and hand them
> over to landless peasants, paying the rates that the United Fruit Company had
> given as their value for tax purposes, which, of course, they regarded as very
> unfair, because they had, naturally, been lying and cheating about the value.
> So that was his achievement. And in fact the public relations industry in
> general has been dedicated to this project ever since.
>
> The Creel Commission, incidentally, is a predecessor of a contemporary
> phenomenon that the Reagan administration constructed, it’s their Office of
> Latin American Public Diplomacy. That’s by far the largest propaganda agency in
> American history, and maybe one of the largest of any Western government. And
> it was also dedicated to controlling the public mind. It was dedicated,
> primarily, to controlling the debate and discussion over Central America, to
> demonizing the Sandinistas, as one of its officials put it, and mobilizing
> support for the U.S. terror States in the region. And it did it by framing the
> debate, by intimidating critics, by producing fabrications which were then
> happily repeated by the media.
>
> So, for example, one famous one, just to illustrate some of it’s achievements,
> when Ronald Regan in 1986 read a spectacular and effective speech, which
> convinced Congress to vote a hundred-million dollars of aid for the Contras,
> right after the World Court had denounced the United- had condemned the United
> States for the unlawful use of force, and called upon it to end this
> aggression. This speech was extremely effective. It described all the- you
> know, whole litany of Nicaraguan crimes, and it ended up by saying that these
> communists actually concede that they are planning to conquer the hemisphere
> and undermine us all. They themselves say that they are carrying out a
> revolution without borders. That was the peroration, that’s the way he ended
> up, you know, big excitement, Congress voted the aid, the Reagan administration
> declared that this meant war, this was a real war, and everybody was excited
> and happy.
>
> Now, that phrase, revolution without borders, actually had already been used.
> It had been used by a State department pamphlet that was called revolution
> without borders, describing Sandinista crimes. And there’s actually a version
> of that phrase that exists. The phrase appears, or something like it appears,
> in a speech by Sandinista commandante Tomas Borge. He had given a speech in
> which he said that the Nicaraguan- the Sandinistas hoped to construct a kind of
> a model society, a society which will be- which will work so well, and will
> serve the needs of the poor so well, that others will be inclined to try to do
> the same thing for themselves. And he went on to say that there- that every
> country has to- every country has to carry out its own revolution, there’s no
> way for one country to make a revolution somewhere else, but the model that the
> Sandinistas were constructing, he hoped, was to be so successful that others
> would want to do it, and he said, in this sense our revolution transcends
> borders.
>
> Well, that phrase was immediately picked up by the Office of Public Diplomacy
> and turned into a threat to conquer the hemisphere. That fraud was at once
> exposed by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which sends out a weekly news
> analysis in Washington that journalists read. It was even exposed- it was even
> mentioned in the Washington Post, somewhere in the back pages. They noted that
> the phrase, revolution without borders, was not exactly what he had said. In
> fact it was nothing to do- it was the opposite of what he had said, but that
> didn’t make any difference. The phrase was useful, the construction was useful,
> and since then, the media — and when the State department document came out
> there was no criticism of it, when Reagan made the speech nobody pointed out
> that this was a fabrication, even the Washington Post, which had exposed it,
> referred to the Sandinista revolution without borders — the media have
> repeatedly- have repeated this over and over again, look they say themselves
> they’re going to have a revolution without borders, and so on.
>
> Well, that’s the kind of thing that’s done by an effective propaganda agency,
> of course, if the media are willing to go along, because it wasn’t very hard to
> figure out that this was an incredible fraud. Well, that’s the kind of thing
> that was done.
>
> All of these operations were completely illegal. There was a Congressional
> report done on them- General- GAO report, which simply pointed out that of
> course they’re illegal — they were run out of the National Security Council,
> and, not allowed to propagandize Americans. But it was very successful. When
> this was exposed during the Iran-Contra hearings, one top administration
> official described the activities of the Office of Public Diplomacy as one of
> their really great achievements. It was a, he said, a spectacular success. He
> described it as the kind of operation that you carry out in enemy territory.
> And that’s quite an appropriate phrase. I think the phrase expresses exactly
> the way in which the public is viewed by people with power: it’s an enemy, it’s
> a domestic enemy, and you got to keep it under control, and you have to make
> sure that the mysteries are not revealed, so that the people don’t become so
> curious and arrogant that they refuse to submit to a civil rule, to put it in
> 17th Century terms. And to control that domestic enemy, propaganda and
> fabrications, and so on, are important, and that’s what the public relations
> industry is for, for corporate purposes, and what the media are for if they
> properly serve the State.
>
> Well that’s- notice again, we have a view that says the media should not
> function the way the standard rhetoric claims.
>
> There’s also an academic twist to this — let’s come closer to home.
>
> If you go back to the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences published
> in 1933 — days when people were a little more open and honest in what they said
> — there’s an article on propaganda, and it’s well worth reading. There’s an
> entry under propaganda. The entry is written by a leading- one- maybe the
> leading American political scientist, Harold Lasswell, who was very
> influential, particularly in this area, communications, and so on. And in this
> entry in the International Encyclopedia on propaganda he says, we should not
> succumb to democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own
> interests. They’re not, he said. Even with the rise of mass education- doesn’t
> mean that people can judge their own interests. They can’t. The best judges of
> their interests are elites — the specialized class, the cool observers, the
> people who have rationality — and therefore they must be granted the means to
> impose their will. Notice, for the common good. Because, again, because- well,
> he says, because of the ignorance and superstition of the masses, he said it’s
> necessary to have a whole new technique of control, largely through propaganda.
> Propaganda, he says, we shouldn’t have a negative connotation about, it’s
> neutral. Propaganda, he says, is as neutral as a pump handle. You can use it
> for good, you can use it for bad; since were good people, obviously, — that’s
> sort of true by definition — we’ll use it for good purposes, and there should
> be no negative connotations about that. In fact, it’s moral to use it, because
> that’s the only way that you can save the ignorant and stupid masses of the
> population from their own errors. You don’t let a three year old run across the
> street, and you don’t let ordinary people make their own decisions. You have to
> control them.
>
> And why do you need propaganda? Well, he explains that. He says, in
> military-run or feudal societies — what we would these days call totalitarian
> societies — you don’t really need propaganda that much. And the reason is
> you’ve got a- you’ve got a club in your hand. You can control the way people
> behave, and therefore it doesn’t matter much what they think, because if they
> get out of line you can control them — for their own good, of course. But once
> you lose the club, you know, once the State loses its capacity to coerce by
> force, then you have some problems. The voice of the people is heard — you’ve
> got all these formal mechanisms around that permit people to express
> themselves, and even participate, and vote, and that sort of thing — and you
> can’t control them by force, because you’ve lost that capacity. But the voice
> of the people is heard, and therefore you’ve got to make sure it says the right
> thing. And in order to make sure it says the right thing, you’ve got to have
> effective and sophisticated propaganda, again, for their own good.
>
> So in a- as a society becomes more free — that is, there’s less capacity to
> coerce — it simply needs more sophisticated indoctrination and propaganda. For
> the public good.
>
> The similarity between this and Leninist ideology is very striking. According
> to Leninist ideology, the cool observers, the radical intelligentsia, will be
> the vanguard who will lead the stupid and ignorant masses on to, you know,
> communist utopia, because they’re too stupid to work it out by themselves.
>
> And in fact there’s been a very easy transition over these years between one
> and the other position. You know, it’s very striking that continually people
> move from one position to the other, very easily. And I think the reason for
> the ease is partly because they’re sort of the same position. So you can be
> either a Marxist-Leninist commissar, or you can be somebody celebrating the
> magnificence of State capitalism, and you can serve those guys. It’s more or
> less the same position. You pick one or the other depending on your estimate of
> where power is, and that can change.
>
> The- and in fact the mainstream of the intelligentsia, I think over the last,
> say, through this century, have tended to be in one or the other camp. Either-

> obvious reasons — I don’t have to bother saying. And there’s the same appeal of
> these doctrines to the intelligentsia, because it puts them in the position of
> justifying- of having a justified role as ideological managers, in the service
> of real power, corporate/State power. For the public good, of course. So you
> naturally are tempted to one or the other position.
>
> Well, going on to the post Second World War period, the same ideas continue to
> be expressed. For example in 1948, when it was again necessary to drive the
> reluctant and indifferent majority to a new war fever — remember 1948, the war
> was over, everybody was pacifistic, they wanted to go home and buy
> refrigerators, and so on, and they didn’t want any more wars, they wanted to
> de-mobilize, we’re done with that stuff — but they had to be whipped up into a
> war fever, because there was a new war coming along, the Cold War, which was a
> real war, as the internal documents explain, and it was necessary to bludgeon
> them into a belief in the demands of the Cold War, as Dean Acheson put it.
>
> The- a presidential- well-known historian, presidential historian, Thomas
> Baily, explained in 1948, that because the masses are notoriously
> short-sighted, and generally cannot see danger until it is at their throats,
> our statesmen are forced to deceive them into an awareness of their own
> long-run interests. Deception of the people may, in fact, become increasingly
> necessary, unless we are willing to give our leaders in Washington a freer
> hand.
>
> In other words, if we continue this nonsense of trying to control them through
> elections, and that sort of thing, it’s going to be necessary to have deception
> of the people, because the masses are too stupid and ignorant to understand the
> danger that’s at their throat. And that’s the role of the media, to carry out
> the appropriate deception.
>
> Coming up to the present, or near-present. In 1981, when we were launching a
> new crusade for freedom, in Central America, Samuel Huntington, who is a
> professor of government at Harvard, and a long-time government advisor,
> explained in a discussion in the Harvard journal International Security, that

> what, of course, we’re now doing. We’re fighting Nicaragua, but you’ve got to
> create the misimpression that it’s the Soviet Union that you’re fighting.
> That’s the job of the Office of Latin American Public Diplomacy, and of the

>
> A second point about the propaganda model is that it's- it's got a kind of

> that true? Well, simply ask yourself what the major media are.
>
> Now, the way the media work, there are some media which kind of set the agenda,
> you know, the most important ones, like The New York Times and The Washington
> Post, big national media, they set the agenda. If the government wants a story

> that television will pick it up and say, OK that’s important, so we’ll give it

> the- you know, you look at that stuff that’s ground out of the AP wire, you’ll

> it’s not, sort of, a hundred percent, but there is a kind of an agenda setting
> media — New York Times, Washington Post, the three television channels, a few
> others that participate to some extent in this.
>
> Well, ask yourself what those institutions are. Answer: those institutions are
> first of all major corporations, some of the biggest corporations in the

>
> So, what you have is businesses- corporations, which are selling relatively
> privileged audiences to other businesses. Well, just ask yourself the natural

> corporations selling privileged audiences to other corporations. Well, what you

>

>
> Well, let’s look a little more closely.
>
> First of all, what is La Prensa? La Prensa is a journal which calls for the

> because he had declared opposition to the draft. The- so- and in fact there’s
> nothing comparable to this in the history of the West, or in world history

>
> Now, La Prensa is described in the United States as the journal that opposed
> Somoza. In fact there was a journal called La Prensa which did oppose the
> Somoza regime, courageously, its editor was, in fact, murdered, and it had the
> same name as this journal, La Prensa, and it’s described as the same journal.
> But is that true? Well, now it’s a little tricky at this point. It certainly

>
> In 1980 the owners of La Prensa decided to convert the journal into a- into a
> journal dedicated to the overthrow of the government. At that point they fired
> the editor — the brother of the editor who had been murdered under Somoza — and
> there was a split in the staff. Eighty percent of the staff left with the
> editor and formed a new journal, El Nuevo Diario, which is the successor of the
> old La Prensa, at least if a newspaper is defined by its editor and its staff,
> not- of course if it’s defined by the money that’s behind it supplied by the
> CIA, then you have a different answer to what’s the old La Prensa. That,
> incidentally, is also something that’s never discussed.
>
> But suppose that’s true, let’s suppose it’s just a CIA journal, and in fact

>
> And now at this point we ask the obvious question: is this passionate

> passions, or is it based on service to the State?
>
> Well, there’s a way of answering that question. In fact we all know the way of

> Council, which is a communist front peace organization, or the East German
> Peace Committee, you know, the Government Peace Committee. You read that

> great outrage over these horrors. Often that material is accurate, and often in

>
> We now ask the same question about the defenders of liberty of the press in the

> many such cases, very close by in fact.
>
> So take El Salvador. El Salvador had independent newspapers at one time. It

> NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah. Well, that’s kind of a little more subtle and complex,

> Well we looked for such cases. We- in particular we looked for atrocities. And

>
> Now there’s actually another prediction that comes out of that model, which we
